Day 1

What is React?
    React is a library for building user interfaces
        Composition
        Unidirectional Dataflow
        Explicit Mutations
        Just Javascript

Composition -- Components--ie:
    <Slider />
    <Navbar />
    <Date />
    <Router />
    <Map />
    <Datepicker />
    <Header />
    <Calendar />
    <Avatar />
    <Carousel />
    <Chart />
    <Icon />

Unidirection Data Flow
    Event handlers update the state and react renders the UI based on the state.

Explicit Mutations
    every component can have its own states explicitly set.

Around 58 min of day2 is a good explanation of how to use `bind()` to force `this` to reference what you want.
