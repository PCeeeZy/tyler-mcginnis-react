What is React?
    React is a library for building user interfaces
        Composition
        Unidirectional Dataflow
        Explicit Mutations
        Just Javascript

Composition -- Components--ie:
    <Slider />
    <Navbar />
    <Date />
    <Router />
    <Map />
    <Datepicker />
    <Header />
    <Calendar />
    <Avatar />
    <Carousel />
    <Chart />
    <Icon />

Unidirection Data Flow
    Event handlers update the state and react renders the UI based on the state.

Explicit Mutations
    every component can have its own states explicitly set.
